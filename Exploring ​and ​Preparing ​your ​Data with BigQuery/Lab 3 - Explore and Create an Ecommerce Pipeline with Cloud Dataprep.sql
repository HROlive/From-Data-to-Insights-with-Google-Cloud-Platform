# Why is there a red bar under the productSKU column?
-- Answer: The red bar indicates mismatched values. Cloud Dataprep automatically identified the productSKU
.. column type as an integer. Cloud Dataprep also detected some non-integer values and therefore flagged 
-- those as mismatched. In fact, the productSKU is not always an integer (for example, a correct value might
-- be "GGOEGOCD078399"). So in this case, Cloud Dataprep incorrectly identified the column type: it should
-- be a string, not an integer.
